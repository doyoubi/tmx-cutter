tmx-cutter
==========
In tile map editor http://www.mapeditor.org/ , to build physic world, we usually use object layers.
But sometimes, it's more convenient to tag a whole tile to be conlidable or not just using a seperate invisible layer.
Since adding every tile to physics world one by one will lead to bad performance for collision detection,
I want to group some tiles together before send them to physicsl world.

This tool will only support orthogonal viewing map. It will accept a tmx file and produce larger rectangle which can be used as AABB in physics world.
"Cutter" of tmx-cutter means cut the tile polygon into rectangular pieces.

This tools is based on tmx-parser https://github.com/soryy708/tmx-parser

tmx-parser
==========

Fork of http://code.google.com/p/tmx-parser/

This is a library for parsing the maps generated by the Map Editor called Tiled.
The TMX format is based upon XML and may contain compressed and encoded tile data to save memory and reduce file sizes.
This parser uses the TinyXML library and its DOM interface to parse TMX files.

Here are some of the features and advantages of this library:

- Conformity with the [TMX specification page](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format).
- Decodes and decompresses tile data.
- Can parse properties as both integers, real numbers and literals (strings).
- Can parse the map file when stored in memory.
- Does not rely on any graphics library. 

This library uses [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) for decompression of tile layer data.

A simple example file is provided to understand how to use the library.

Compilation instructions are provided in the project's Wiki. However, it is recommended to include the source code in your application's source code to prevent library collisions. The only source files you will need are the ones starting with Tmx and the base64 directory. Libraries that need to be linked are TinyXML and zlib.
